# Audible Royalty Scam Dashboard

A data-driven dashboard that exposes the predatory royalty structure behind Audible's AYCL and Premium+ programs. Built to help indie authors and narrators understand what they *should* be earning — and plan their exit strategy from Audible's ecosystem.

## 🎯 Goal

To visualize and compare:
- Earnings from AYCL (All-You-Can-Listen) royalties
- Traditional royalty share models (ACX Exclusive, Royalty Share, Findaway, etc.)
- Direct sales platforms like BookFunnel Audio

## ⚠️ Why This Matters

Authors and narrators are losing hundreds — even thousands — in royalties due to Audible's misleading payout schemes. This tool helps creators:

- See what they’re really earning
- Simulate alternate payout models
- Track how long it takes to recoup audiobook production costs
- Make informed decisions about staying or going wide

## 🔧 Features

- Simulated data via `Faker` to illustrate earnings scenarios
- Royalty calculators by platform
- Earnings visualizations (bar, pie, break-even meters)
- “What if you went wide?” projections
- Dashboard built in Streamlit (coming soon!)
